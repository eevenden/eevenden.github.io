	  <p> My name is Emily Evenden. I am a driven, organized, analytical, and innovative Geographic Information Systems (GIS) specialist with additional education in environmental change and sustainability. <p>

<p> Currently, I am pursuing my Masters of Science in Geographic Information Sciences at Clark University in Worcester, MA. I am also Remote Sensing Research Assistant at Clark Labs.

As a research assistant, I currently create machine-learning models of natural landscape loss to agricultural expansion and urbanization and predict landcover for the year 2050. Specifically, I am working on individually modeling each country in Asia. 

Previously as a research assistant, I was using multi-layer perceptron neural networks to classify mangrove forests and aquaculture ponds in Landsat imagery of Southeast Asia to identify trends in mangrove deforestation.<p>
		
<p> Prior to attending Clark University, I earned my Bachelors of Arts in Environmental Studies with Summa Cum Laude Honors from the George Washington University (GW) in Washington, D.C. As a GW student, I pursued several GIS-related internships for organizations including the U.S. Agency of International Development and the Washington D.C. Economic Partnership. 

In addition, I was an Undergraduate Research Assistant for the Circumpolar Active Layer Monitoring (CALM) program, a National Science Foundation initiative monitoring  active-layer permafrost thaw in the Arctic. With CALM, I traveled to northern Alaska with a field work team to sample active-layer thickness. <p>

<p> I am a Sweden-born, Finnish-speaking, Philadelphia-raised lady with three citizenships (USA, Finland, and the UK). In my free time, I am an active hiker and painter. My friends might describe me as thoughtful, creative, hard-working, and confident.<p>
